### MK's Dotfile Creed

>This is my dotfile. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My dotfile is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.  
Without me, my dotfile is useless. Without my dotfile, I am useless. I must keep my dotfile true. I must keep dotfiles sharper and up-to-date than the shells that are trying to frustrate me. I must pawn it before it owns me. I will ...  
My dotfile and I know that what counts in development is not the shells we use, the aliases they provide, nor the themes we make. We know that it is the personal touch and functions that count. We will keep it functional ...  
My dotfile is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its functions, its accessories,and its aliases. I will keep my dotfile clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will ...  
Before God, I swear this creed. My dotfile and I are the defenders of my code. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my dev environment.  
So be it, until victory is Developer's and there is no enemy, but peace!  



PS: To setup a new mac, update .install-list for any brew packages you want to add and run:
```zsh
./setup-my-mac
``` 
run ```./symlink``` only if you want to symlink dotfiles and not run entire setup.
